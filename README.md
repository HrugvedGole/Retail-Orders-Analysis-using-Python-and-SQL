# Retail-Orders-Analysis-using-Python-and-SQL

# Project Overview

This project involves analyzing retail orders data to uncover meaningful insights. The project comprises two main parts: data cleaning and transformation using Python, followed by data analysis using MySQL. The data was sourced from Kaggle and loaded using the Kaggle API. The key stages of the project include data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading (ETL), followed by comprehensive data analysis using SQL queries.

# Project Structure

## 1. Data Extraction and Loading

Kaggle API: Used to fetch retail orders data from Kaggle.

Python Libraries: Utilized pandas for data manipulation, zipfile for handling compressed files, and kaggle for interacting with the Kaggle API.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation

Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing values to ensure data integrity.

Data Transformation: Transformed raw data into a usable format, including converting data types and creating new columns for enhanced analysis.

New Columns: Created additional columns that would be useful for analysis, such as calculated fields and derived metrics.

## 3. Data Loading

MySQL Database: Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into a MySQL database for further analysis.

ETL Process: Documented the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure reproducibility and accuracy.

## 4. Data Analysis

SQL Queries: Performed various SQL queries to extract insights from the data.

Common Table Expressions (CTE): Used CTEs for structuring complex queries.

Date Formats: Handled and manipulated date formats for time-based analysis.

Grouping and Aggregating: Grouped data by various dimensions and aggregated metrics to uncover trends and patterns.

Advanced SQL Concepts: Utilized subqueries and window functions to perform in-depth analysis.

# Detailed Description of Each Stage

## Data Extraction: 
Kaggle API: The Kaggle API was used to download the retail orders dataset.

zipfile: The downloaded dataset was in a compressed format. The zipfile library was used to extract the contents.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Pandas: The pandas library was extensively used for data cleaning and manipulation.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values were identified and handled using various strategies such as imputation and removal, depending on the context.

Data Type Conversion: Ensured that all columns had appropriate data types for accurate analysis.

New Columns: Created new columns, such as profit, discount, etc

# Data Loading

MySQL Database: The cleaned dataset was loaded into a MySQL database.

Data Insertion: Inserted the cleaned data into the database tables.

# Data Analysis

CTEs: Utilized Common Table Expressions to simplify and organize complex queries.

Date Formats: Converted and formatted date columns to enable time-based analyses.

Grouping and Aggregating: Grouped data by various dimensions such as product category, month, and customer segment, and calculated aggregate metrics like total sales, average order value, etc.

Advanced SQL Techniques: Employed joins to combine data from multiple tables, subqueries for nested data retrieval, and window functions for running totals and moving averages.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, starting from data extraction and cleaning using Python to advanced data analysis using MySQL. The insights gained from this analysis can help retail businesses make informed decisions based on data trends and patterns.
